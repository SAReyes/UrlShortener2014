# Functionalities
### URL Reachable (Implemented)
It is a Web Service that checks if a given URL can be reached or not. For that purpose it invokes a HEAD request method.
If the response of the HEAD request is successful (status 200) within a fixed timeout, then the URL is reachable.
If either the timeout expire without any response, or the URL tries to redirect to another site (status 3XX), 
or response contains any error status (4XXX, 5XX), then the URL is not reachable.

This Service is used directly by the front-end of the UrlShortener2014 application.
When the user introduces a URL to shorten, an Ajax call is made to this service in order to check if the URL is reachable or not, only if the user selects the "Check reachable" check box.

Relevant libraries used:
* java.net.HttpURLConnection

### Platform and browser identifier (Implemented)
It is a Web Service that obtains the platform and the browser from a given User-Agent header.
It also obtains the browser version whenever it's known.

This Service is used by the UrlShortenerControllerWithLogs Service of the UrlShortener2014 application.
When the UrlShortenerControllerWithLogs service is asked for a redirection, a Rest call is made to this service in order to obtain the platform and browser of the client device.

Relevant libraries used:
* nl.bitwalker.useragentutils.UserAgent

### BlackList (Implemented)
It is a Web Service that checks if a given URL is considered as Spam by some third-party anti-spam DNS Servers.
The idea of the service comes from the next PHP plugin: https://github.com/YOURLS/antispam
This service processes the input URL and builds three different DNS queries. Those queries are executed concurrently.
If any of the three responses received is positive, then the URL is considered as spam. Otherwise, it is considered as not-spam.
The service implements a cache system which makes possible to save the execution of the DNS queries whenever the URL is in the cache.

The Service is used by the UrlShortenerControllerWithLogs Service of the UrlShortener2014 application.
When the UrlShortenerControllerWithLogs service is asked for a new short url, a Rest call is made to this service in order to check if the URL is contained in any of the
third-party anti-spam databases. In the case the URL is considered as not-spam, a ShortURL is created and returned from the UrlShortenerControllerWithLogs service
to the user. The DNS queries for a given URL are executed just the first time. The following calls will be asked by the cache system with no need to actually execute the query. 
When the UrlShortenerControllerWithLogs service is asked for a redirection, a Rest call is made to this service in order to to check if the URL is spam or not.
If the URL was created (or checked) up to two hours ago, there is no need to execute the DNS query and a stored "safe" field is used to determine if it's spam or not.
Otherwise, if the URL was checked more than two hours ago, then the DNS query is executed.

Relevant libraries used:
* java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService

### Interstitial Ad (Implemented)
It is a Web Service that generates a Short URL from a given targetURL and sponsorURL. In that Short URL, a sponsor banner is shown for 10 seconds, and then it is automatically redirected to the target URL.
The sponsorURL will be randomly chosen from a list of websites.

This Service is used by the UrlShortenerControllerWithLogs Service of the UrlShortener2014 application.
The user can decide if he wants to insert a sponsorURL or not, using the "Insert banner" checkbox from the interface.
When the UrlShortenerControllerWithLogs service is asked for a new short url with banner, a Rest call is made to this service in order to generate the new ShortURL and return it to the user, including the html body which has to be shown when it is accessed.
